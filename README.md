## This project is newly created and under development. We are actively looking for community feedback on aminoglycoside resistance 
## genes and their nomenclature in CARD.

### CARD-ARCS:

The Aminoglycoside Resistance Classification System (ARCS) is an ontological nomenclature system and suite of tools for analyzing and classifying 
aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs) using a combination of functionality, regiospecifity and phenotype.
